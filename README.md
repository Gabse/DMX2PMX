This simple device converts a standard DMX512 Signal into two Pulsar PMX signals.

It lets you reuse your old Pulsar/ClayPaky gear with almost any standard DMX controller on the market.

The device has 2 independent outputs giving the user the posibility to split the incomming signal into two outputs 
to achieve a faster update rate than by using a single PMX channel only (â‰ˆ2,08ms per channel in 7 bit mode).

The number of desired channels per output and the bit mode can be modified in the sourcecode file.

9 Dip Swithes make it possible to set a DMX start address, in order to expand existing DMX universes.

The opto-isolated input helps to avoid ground loops between the DMX and the PMX side.
